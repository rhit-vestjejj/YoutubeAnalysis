Darn! It's too bad there's not a federal agency that can help out. Prayers
No more FEMA. Maybe a bake sale?  Concepts of thoughts & Prayers!
Don‚Äôt worry. I prayed the flooding to stop.
DEI caused the flooding?
"And No FEMA, YOU NEED TO CALL YOUR GOVERNOR NOW!"
And Trump denied FEMA to Gov Kemp. Shame.
I just recently saw videos from people in these states talking trash to people in California over their fires and how they don‚Äôt deserve help.
"Don't worry ,Kentucky and Virginia, Trump is on his way to help ,with hope and prayers. Get your tents ready."
Maybe t-rump will come and throw out packages of paper towels.
"at least we have billionaire oligarchs in charge of the disaster relief funds, I'm sure they'll use those funds selflessly and not embezzle them"
It looks like all of that water will be flowing into the Gulf of America.
PRAYERS FOR EVERYONE.
Daddy trump said no more federal disaster funding! He's currently at a NASCAR race instead of on the ground addressing the nation. Let's hope the poorest states in the nation can handle this alone. My heart goes out for the people affected.
Hope no one‚Äôs expecting Federal aid! üá∫üá∏
Too bad there will be no more FEMA to help you now. You are on your own!
Call your orange guy
Call Mitch and hopefully he won‚Äôt freeze up
"I suggest that before winter, they should inspect and clear all the canals to reroute the water into our reservoirs to avoid flooding."
"We used to have FEMA to provide help but ya'all voted it away! Kentucky, Virginia and Tennessee remember it's on your individual states to provide your relief now!"
"Ohhh the irony.. of
""Cry me a river"" 
They voted for the guy who gutted all the help for citizens "
Sending concepts of thoughts and prayers
Could we please put an end to the weather modification.
These are the same people that were laughing at California on fire. I have sympathy for them but they sure make it hard.
This was terrible but what made it so much worse was how the president and vice president responded to it!
Maybe Elon can block the water with some Cybertrucks. 
Did they ask tRump/ Musk for help. Good luck fellow humans. 
OMGosh. My prayers and heart go out to all of you. Stay safe. Debbie
Don't call FEMA. Nobody there to take your call.
"Sorry you are going through this.  FEMA is gone, and there are so many catastrophes that we cannot help.  This is not the country I had hoped to leave you.  Signed sadly, a neighbor and fellow American in another state a long way away."
The unity in this thread is amazing
Somebody call Rand Paul and Mitch McConnell!
"Call FEMA. Oh, wait..they are no longer available to assist you."
Here in Appalachian mountains Virginia for past 25 years and I've never seen creeks by my house raging this bad . And today we have high winds and may The Lord Jesus Christ keep us all safe affected by this modified storm . And restore those who lost property or loved ones .
Kentucky and Tennessee voted for Trump so they cannot complain. Va can go call the Republican governor and see if he is willing to help
Huh. You who trashed FEMA and California... this up to you to fix now. Good luck.
Praying for everyone  Ô∏è stay safe  Ô∏è God bless you and yours ..Thank-you for the video
Trump coming with his paper towels.
"' !  ' WISHING  ALL  WELL '  ! ' !  ! "" Responsibility Matters for ALL Lives "" ! USA ! *"
"You are on your own, MAGA."
And people argue that there's no such thing as climate change. I've been around long enough that I've never seen most of this stuff before. It's going to snow in Texas.
"Bummer folks. That's just not in the budget this year. Good thing we put our faith in corporate America to save us. They've surely got their ""families"" best interests in mind. Haha"
Hope the insurance will cover the damages. I am sure private corporations and your state will be enough help. No more federal hand me downs
Math and science. (That's the educated version of thoughts and prayers)
Trump cares more about Nascar than national emergencies.
"I believe it is the states right to pay for their own disaster relief with their own revenue. These states dont need no help from the federal government. They are strong, independent , proud people that do not  need no federal handouts."
Indeed I tremble for my country when reflect that God is just: that his justice cannot sleep for ever: Thomas Jefferson.
"Don't  worry, Trump will save all the Hillbillies!"
Make sure you put your Harris yard signs out so you're not overlooked for assistance if needed.  Extra points for rainbow flags stickers on windows or doors.
"That's some bad flooding. Well, good luck. You're on your own."
"President Musk and Trump are getting rid of the NOAA. So, at least you wont know when the next storm is coming. "
Won't be FEMA. It's gone.
But trump and Elon said global warming not real
So sorry sending prayers 
Kentucky voted overwhelming for Trump now let's see what he does for you all.
"Remember, all of this is normal..."
Weellll trump sure had a mouthful for biden! Lets see the big guy make america great... AGAIN!
let‚Äôs see how everyone in the comments feels about their FEMA response when it‚Äôs their town that gets flash flooded
‚ÄúThoughts and prayers‚Äù hehehe
"God, please bless our brothers and sisters to be safe during this emergency.  "
Trump already said no FEMA. The states have to delegate all these recovery efforts without the federal government.
FEMA..USAID.. well you got bootstraps. I hope no one gets hurt.
"Lots of people were gloating about the California wildfires and saying California deserves it because apparently they are sodom and gomorrah. How do those same people view these natural disasters? I will not gloat about what is happening to any of these people, that is a sickening thing to do."
I bet you that Noem will not be there filling sand bags. 
One drainage ditch could have helped avoid all this this . Blame your city planners
Trump is on the way with 100 paper towel rolls. That should be enough.
"""Fema!Fema!Fema! We need help.""
Trump/Musk government:
""We are sorry, that number has been disconnected."""
"I love how ignorant some of these comments are.  I'd much rather the disaster money go straight to the state rather than the ill prepared and wasteful ""FEMA disaster relief"" middleman."
Now which democratic did this 
9 dead. Flooding threats to 3 states......and still hate bashing in the comments. This world is a sad place. We all need Jesus
Southern WV in McDowell County also hit Hard 
probably going to get a lot less than $750 with that spending freeze.
"Virginia State DOT and your county public works will be out to fix your roads in time. Churches will provide those meals and shelter for all who need it, and everyone will tighten their belts and save for the repair costs. So glad that these citizens aren't forced to take money taken from other states by the Federal government anymore."
"Was tempted to write the ""too bad there's no FEMA"" comment.  But instead, Id rather say that these are our brother's and sisters..and politics aside, we love you and are here to help if you will accept it. Donations anyone??"
God bless you all
Faith or Prayer will do nothing when there is no governmental or corporate support for the people who lost everything in this particular natural disaster.
Praying for all please dont worry about flooding when it gets to this point. Worry about evacuating stay safe.
"Damn guys, I feel so bad for everyone getting hammered out east!"
I love how separated the houses are from each other. Out here in California we all lived piled on top of each other which I'm sure is the root cause of all the violence & aggression
Loving it !
"Let‚Äôs see how trump treats them or who gets blamed for this tragedy.
Hopefully, everyone is safe and gets out of trouble, water is the strongest body on earth, do not take risks, get professional help."
Looks ‚Äúmismanaged‚Äù
"Samaritan's Purse is a good organization. They were some of the first on the scene after Helene. It seems there are a lot of people who care based on these comments. Let's all give a little. We may be broke, but at least we are not as far in debt as our government."
Trump is at the Nascar race rained out.
"Fresh off the heels of Trump cutting FEMA. No worries, they'll send you plenty of thoughts and prayers to help you rebuild Ô∏è"
We are flooded here in WV also. Pretty bad.
YHWH will fight for us!
Sucks that there‚Äôs no FEMA
SAVE THE STILLS!! 
Trump must have opened the wrong valve ?
I wonder if this is because Hurricane Helene changed the landscape so drastically.
Feel bad for Virginia. They didn‚Äôt vote to shut down FEMA. I hope you fire your MAGA governor tho
Someone please call 911
Gonna need a ton of construction equipment to help these poor folks.
Any agencies left to aid in this disaster?
"Remember tax cuts for the rich, is what the Mojo or Doge thing is all about."
"Si chaque jour √©tait aussi amusant que de regarder cette vid√©o, notre relation serait parfaite"
"to end the corruption lets hope Elon digs in his heels  and refuses to send  Federal FEMA dollars and Aid to these red conservative states ...
saving the rest of us $trillions of Federal tax dollars"
Oh my God no FEMA yeah cuz that $710 would help so much
They must need better forest management! I say no funding until they can figure out how to manage their forests better.
"Ask Hegseth for help out of the $50,000 he's getting for an EMERGENCY PAINT JOB for his FREE MILITARY HOUSING.   It's an e urgency because he just can't live in a tacky house."
Only one I feel bad for is Virginia since they‚Äôre a state that didn‚Äôt vote for the president who wants to end fema
"Rain patterns have changed, yet civil engineering codes and reference specifications for engineering for rsin events has not. They still use old historical rainfall probailities from 1950s which are based on 1930s patterns."
"Californian here, this is hilarious to watch."
Don't go near the water!
This comment section is not a reliable source of information. People you have to use critical thinking and stop regurgitating the same 4 rumors. pay attention to what is happening cause its only getting worse.
"and the president is relaxing at the Daytona 500, thoughts and prayers, FAFO"
God please help them get through this.
Prayers
Good thing there's FEMA.
"So, catastrophic flooding in Trump states and he's at a car race? Wasting millions of dollars? "
"Thoughts and prayers, MAGAts."
I hope those T-rump supporters know their savior T-rump won‚Äôt send help‚Ä¶
"The song, How do you like me now by Toby Keith (dead now but so loved his dear leader)....it's playing full blast!!"
We are hurting right now :(
That looks the Golf of America.
I'm sure the  stable genius will figure it out for you all.
Prey for my mama.
Please be safe everyone..prayers for you all.
"Notice the houses on a hill? OUT OF THE FLOOD ZONE? THATS WHY! 
Floods."
Blame it on DEI.
Start pulling on them bootstraps y'all..
Welp. The states have to help themselves Ô∏è
No FEMA help available. Felon45 does not care about those that voted for him. You all will have to look for help elsewhere.
Now lets see if your vote count's for trump lets just see whats going to happen yall know he cut FEMA right just speaking facts but i hope everyone is safe and alive im a human being not a MAGA nut job praying for y'all safety and a speedy recovery 
Prayers for safety 
Not again. Prayers
I hope they aren‚Äôt relying on FEMA to help out Ô∏è
There is a US patent on weather modification
And Fema denied help to the Helene huricane victims
"Get FEMA on the line! 

What FEMA???"
They voted for Trump! FAFO.....
Like magic it will all go away...
Let‚Äôs go FEMA
""
Is this natural disaster due to DEI?
What I want to know is anyone going to do anything about the cloud seeding that's causing this all over?
Paper towels on the way!
Maybe Trump can build a wall there to keep all the water there? 
FAFO season for red states. Keep voting against your interests
Also in West Virginia we are a state also
Horrific 
And maybe Trump can develop Kentucky instead of Gaza
"Mabey girl scouts can sell enough cookies to cover this disaster, maga congressmen will offer prayers, FEMA would offer assistance if they could, but they can't,  Trump's orders."
Its called river valley for a reason!
Too bad president musk is getting rid of  FEMA. You all are on your own.
I'm sure Rump will let you drown!
Way down south in the land of traitor rattlesnakes and alligators. run away run away dixie boy run away
Trump n musk will save em
"the flooding wouldnt have happened if they did proper maintenance on their waterways in the flood plaines

this is a clear example of the failures of the States conservative elected reps

still ...
we can afford to send thoughts and prayers , cant we"
God's wrath
Help us diaper don!!!!
Is this in the same area as the hurricane Helena???? Did the same area get hit
Get Trump to toss you a roll of paper towels.

"Blankets ,bottled water,,clothes ,,food ,,,shelter,,üõüÔ∏èÔ∏èÔ∏èÔ∏èÔ∏è"
Look at God!
Where in Virginia is this video being shot?
Too bad the blue states can‚Äôt bail you out AGAIN.

Trump needs to go turn the water  off 
Blame it on DEI

Red states. No worries I'm sure all the help y'all need will.come right to ya 
Is FEMA gone? 
"Don't rebuild. Move to Cleveland, Ohio."
Video would be better full screen
Ask Trump for some help my be he'll hand out more paper towels!!!
Can't you pray for those who are devastated by these floods instead of getting into politics. DISGUSTING
Maybe Trump can get that water collected for the next wildfires in California? No? Too soon?
"Ha, R.I.P. these two Trump states (Virginia is blue state) take L"
What global warming..?
You all need to call Trump your Lord and Savior !
Good luck

"Let's see if FEMA will help, no. Wonder why."
Prayers for the southern cousins
"Red states, oh oh! Good luck running to your savior Trump! Lol."

"Stay right where you're at on that paved drive. 
Please get down on your knees.... And you thank Jesus for living in that beautiful place with all those hills. Say prayers to stop the flooding.... And thank God you are blessed in a beautiful place like that."
Everything should be fine I see in the comments that people are telepathically communicating with an invisible man through prayer
Praying for everyone involved.  I‚Äôm in Kentucky so I know what you are dealing with I wish idiots would leave politics out of these situations!
BIDEN DIDN'T OFFER
